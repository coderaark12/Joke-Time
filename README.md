# Joke-Time

Welcome to the **Joke-Time** repository! This project is a simple website where you can fetch and display jokes using a public API.

## About

In this project, I am practicing making requests to public APIs. The goal is to build a basic web application that retrieves random jokes from a public API and displays them on the website. This is a great way to get hands-on experience with API requests, JavaScript, and web development.

## Features

- Fetches random jokes from a public API.
- Displays the jokes on the webpage.
- Simple and clean user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: For making API requests and handling the data.
- **Node.js**: For server-side scripting.
- **Express**: A web framework for Node.js.
- **EJS**: A templating engine used for rendering HTML with embedded JavaScript.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Public API**: Used to fetch the jokes.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coderaark12/Joke-Time.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd Joke-Time

## Future Improvements
- Add more joke categories.
- Improve the UI/UX.
- Implement additional API features.
